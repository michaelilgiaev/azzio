"""Host-wide hypervisor VM enumeration -- the `hypervisor ls` backend.

Split out of virtual_machine.py: everything here is about discovering EVERY running
hypervisor VM on the host (system-wide), which is a different concern from the
single-VM boot/attach/teardown lifecycle that virtual_machine.py owns. Keeping it
here holds virtual_machine.py's size down and isolates the /proc-scanning logic.

The one impure edge (reading /proc) is factored into _scan_proc_table / _pid_cwd so
the record-building logic (_running_instances) stays PURE and unit-testable with a
fake process table. virtual_machine.py re-imports these names, so `vm.do_ls`,
`vm._running_instances`, `vm._cfg_ssh_port` and `vm._pid_cwd` all still resolve for
the CLI dispatch and the existing tests.
