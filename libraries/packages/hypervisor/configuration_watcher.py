"""configuration_watcher.py - live hypervisor.cfg reload with validation and safe revert.

While a VM runs, the hypervisor watches hypervisor.cfg (mtime poll on a daemon
thread, matching virtual_machine._maximize_window; stdlib only, no new deps). On
every save there are exactly two outcomes:

  1. VALID   -> the new values are applied; changed keys are split into those
                applied LIVE (viewer-side toggles) and those that only take
                effect on the next boot (device topology: ram, cpus, network,
                usb, shared, disk_size, audio).
  2. INVALID -> the file is reverted to the LAST-KNOWN-GOOD contents, so a broken
                edit never bricks the VM.

The accept/revert decision is the PURE function evaluate_save(); it does no I/O
and is fully unit-tested. ConfigWatcher is the thin thread that reads the file,
calls evaluate_save(), and either writes the revert or logs+applies the diff.

WHY so few keys apply live: ram/cpus/-m/-smp, the netdev/NIC, the virtiofs share
and USB host devices are fixed at QEMU launch and cannot be re-plugged safely from a
config poke; changing them needs a fresh boot. The viewer-side flags
(fullscreen / ask-before-quit) and audio are host/viewer concerns rather than
guest device topology, so fullscreen and ask-before-quit are treated as live
(they re-read on the next viewer action / relaunch); everything else is
reboot-required and clearly logged as such.
