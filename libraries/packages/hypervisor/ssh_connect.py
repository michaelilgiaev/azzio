"""ssh_connect.py - the `hypervisor ssh` connect helper.

Split out of virtual_machine.py (which was pushing the 750-line limit) because the
connect helper is a self-contained unit: build the ssh command, then run it while
guaranteeing the local terminal is restored on every exit path.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A hand-typed `ssh -p <port> main@localhost` into the guest puts the
LOCAL controlling terminal into raw mode for the session; on an abnormal teardown
(connection reset, killed pty) the ssh client never restores the saved termios, so
the tab is left in -echo/-icanon and typing no longer echoes ("the bash line
disappears"). do_ssh snapshots termios before ssh and restores it (plus `stty sane`)
in a finally on EVERY exit path, so the terminal is never left broken.
