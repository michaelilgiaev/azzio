"""configuration.py - CWD-derived VM identity, paths, and configuration.

Everything about a VM is derived from the CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY:

    cd ~/Hypervisors/azzio && hypervisor install some.iso

Config object is built once (Config.from_cwd()) and threaded through every
subcommand. VM / PROC / DISK are always derived from the directory and are NOT
overridable. Everything else is read from hypervisor.cfg (priority: env > cfg > default).
