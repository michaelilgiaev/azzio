"""do_share_offline -- the powered-off-disk editor's guard.

This path has no host-independent happy route (it needs qemu-nbd, sudo, a real
Btrfs guest), but its FIRST action is a precondition: the disk for this directory
must exist. That guard is pure and must fail CLEANLY (HypervisorError -> the
'hypervisor: ...' exit-1 path), never crash. A prior refactor that made
resolve_run_disk() require an argument left this call site stale and turned the
missing-disk case into an uncaught TypeError; this pins it shut.
