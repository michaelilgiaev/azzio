"""Single source of truth for the azzio test suite's TEST MODES -- two independent
booleans, `network` and `root`, that select which privileged tiers of the suite run.

Why this exists
---------------
Most of this suite is PURE: it exercises the deterministic Python logic (config-file
emitters, package-list handling, path building, the specification pipeline) against fakes,
never building an ISO, calling pacman/makepkg/mkarchiso, touching the network, or using
sudo. Two tiers are the exception and are gated by a persisted toggle so a plain
`bash tests.sh` stays green with no connectivity and no privileges:

- `network`: a handful of tests reach a REAL host (e.g. the live resolver-server contract
  test). OFFLINE (the default) SKIPS the `network`-marked tests, so a plain run never hangs
  on a DNS lookup. ONLINE runs them. Those tests ALSO keep their own cheap TCP reachability
  probe as a hard safety net, so an ONLINE run on a disconnected box still skips cleanly
  rather than hanging.
- `root`: tests that need UID 0 to run (the two calamares btrfs loop-mount desparse tests).
  USER mode (the default) SKIPS the `root`-marked tests. ROOT mode SELECTS them -- they then
  run IF the process is actually UID 0, and otherwise self-skip via their own `os.geteuid()`
  guard (selecting the tier does not force root).

The two booleans gate in OPPOSITE directions but the file meaning is uniform ("run this
tier?"): `network=true` runs the network tier, `root=true` selects the root tier.

The toggle
----------
Both booleans live in ONE LOCAL file, `tests/test_modes.conf` (default: both `false`), as
`key = value` lines::

    network = false
    root = false

The file is per-machine local state: it is GITIGNORED, not committed. `tests.sh` CREATES it
with the both-`false` default on first run if it is missing, and otherwise leaves it alone, so
a fresh clone starts both-off (nothing to hang on, no sudo demanded) and each machine keeps its
own toggles. Because the file may not exist yet on a brand-new clone before the first
`tests.sh` run, this module treats a MISSING file exactly like the default (both off) -- see
`_read_conf`, which never raises.

Flip the toggles WITHOUT running the suite via `tests.sh --offline/--online` (network) and
`tests.sh --user/--root` (root) -- they rewrite the file and exit. Environment variables
`AZZIO_TESTS_NETWORK` / `AZZIO_TESTS_ROOT` override the file for a single run; tests.sh
exports them to match the file so its run and the two isolated off-screen log-copy runs (whose
repo copies do not contain the conf) all agree, and CI can set them directly.

The root tier additionally DEMANDS sudo: with `root = true` persisted, a plain `bash tests.sh`
run as a non-root user STOPS at the shell layer (in tests.sh) and asks the user to re-run under
sudo, rather than quietly skipping the root-marked tests. The `os.geteuid()` self-skip in the
root-marked tests remains as a second layer (for `-m root` selection and the test-only
`AZZIO_ALLOW_NONROOT` escape hatch, which bypasses the shell-layer demand).

Anything unrecognized (a typo in the file, a bad env value) falls back to the SAFE default
(the tier OFF): an offline run can never hang, and a user-mode run can never need sudo, so an
ambiguous config fails closed, not open. For the network var ONLY, the legacy words `online`
/ `offline` are also accepted (matches the sibling Coder distribution's convention and
existing muscle memory).

    Robustness details that keep this byte-faithful to the bash parser and crash-free:
