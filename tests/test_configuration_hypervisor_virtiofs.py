"""virtiofs shared-folder wiring -- the fix for the reported --shared/--ssh coupling.

The BUG: `--shared` only made the folder appear inside the ssh ISO variant, because
the share was mounted only as a side effect of the ssh bring-up service. Nothing on
the headed variant mounted it, so `--shared` silently did nothing there.

The FIX moves the transport to virtiofs and, on the HOST, spawns a `virtiofsd`
daemon whenever `shared` is set -- REGARDLESS of `ssh`. These tests pin that
decoupling at the pure command-builder level (`virtiofsd_argv`), plus the
`require_virtiofsd` precondition, so the coupling cannot silently come back.
