"""configuration_watcher -- live hypervisor.cfg reload: validate, apply, or safe-revert.

While a VM runs, the hypervisor watches hypervisor.cfg. On every save there are
exactly two outcomes (the user's spec):

  1. VALID   -> the new values are applied by the running hypervisor. Changes are
                split into those applied LIVE and those that need a reboot.
  2. INVALID -> the file is REVERTED to the last-known-good contents, so a broken
                edit never bricks the VM.

The decision is a PURE function, evaluate_save(new_text, last_good). It does no
I/O: it parses+validates the text, and returns what to do. The watcher thread is
a thin wrapper that reads the file, calls this, and writes the revert / applies
the diff. Keeping the decision pure is what makes accept/revert unit-testable
without a running VM -- which is the whole point of the safety guarantee.
